This is a glossary of terms that often appear in discussion about multimedia transmissions. Some of the terms are specific to :term:`GStreamer` or :term:`Kurento`, and most of them are described and linked to their RFC, W3C or Wikipedia documents.

.. glossary::

   Agnostic media
       One of the big problems of media is that the number of variants of video and audio codecs, formats and variants quickly creates high complexity in heterogeneous applications. So Kurento developed the concept of an automatic converter of media formats that enables development of *agnostic* elements. Whenever a media element's source is connected to another media element's sink, the Kurento framework verifies if media adaption and transcoding is necessary and, if needed, it transparently incorporates the appropriate transformations making possible the  chaining of the two elements into the resulting :term:`Pipeline <Media Pipeline>`.

   AVI
       Audio Video Interleaved, known by its initials AVI, is a multimedia container format introduced by Microsoft in November 1992 as part of its Video for Windows technology. AVI files can contain both audio and video data in a file container that allows synchronous audio-with-video playback. AVI is a derivative of the Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF).

   Bower
       `Bower <https://bower.io/>`__ is a package manager for the web. It offers a generic solution to the problem of front-end package management, while exposing the package dependency model via an API that can be consumed by a build stack.

   Builder Pattern
       The builder pattern is an object creation software design pattern whose intention is to find a solution to the telescoping constructor anti-pattern. The telescoping constructor anti-pattern occurs when the increase of object constructor parameter combination leads to an exponential list of constructors. Instead of using numerous constructors, the builder pattern uses another object, a builder, that receives each initialization parameter step by step and then returns the resulting constructed object at once.

   CORS
       Cross-origin resource sharing is a mechanism that allows JavaScript code on a web page to make XMLHttpRequests to different domains than the one the JavaScript originated from. It works by adding new HTTP headers that allow servers to serve resources to permitted origin domains. Browsers support these headers and enforce the restrictions they establish.

       .. seealso::

          :wikipedia:`Cross-origin resource sharing`

          `enable-cors.org <https://enable-cors.org/>`__
              Information on the relevance of CORS and how and when to enable it.

   DOM
       Document Object Model is a cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML, XHTML and XML documents.

   EOS
       End Of Stream is an event that occurs when playback of some media source has finished. In Kurento, some elements will raise an ``EndOfStream`` event.

   GStreamer
       `GStreamer <https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/>`__ is a pipeline-based multimedia framework written in the C programming language.

   H.264
       A Video Compression Format. The H.264 standard can be viewed as a "family of standards" composed of a number of profiles. Each specific decoder deals with at least one such profiles, but not necessarily all.

              Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1

   ICE
       *Interactive Connectivity Establishment* (ICE) is a protocol used for :term:`NAT Traversal`. It defines a technique that allows communication between two endpoints when one is inside a NAT and the other is outside of it. The net effect of the ICE process is that the NAT will be left with all needed ports open for communication, and both endpoints will have complete information about the IP address and ports where the other endpoint can be contacted.

       ICE doesn't work standalone: it uses a couple of helper protocols called :term:`STUN` and :term:`TURN`.

   JSON-RPC
       `JSON-RPC <https://www.jsonrpc.org/>`__ is a simple remote procedure call protocol encoded in JSON. JSON-RPC allows for notifications and for multiple calls to be sent to the server which may be answered out of order.

   Kurento
       `Kurento <https://www.kurento.org/>`__ is a platform for the development of multimedia-enabled applications. Kurento is the Esperanto term for the English word 'stream'. We chose this name because we believe the Esperanto principles are inspiring for what the multimedia community needs: simplicity, openness and universality. Some components of Kurento are the :term:`Kurento Media Server`, the :term:`Kurento API`, the :term:`Kurento Protocol`, and the :term:`Kurento Client`.

   Kurento API
        An object oriented API to create media pipelines to control media. It can be seen as and interface to Kurento Media Server. It can be used from the Kurento Protocol or from Kurento Clients.

   Kurento Client
        A programming library (Java or JavaScript) used to control an instance of **Kurento Media Server** from an application. For example, with this library, any developer can create a web application that uses Kurento Media Server to receive audio and video from the user web browser, process it and send it back again over Internet. The Kurento Client libraries expose the :term:`Kurento API` to application developers.

   Kurento Protocol
        Communication between KMS and clients by means of :term:`JSON-RPC` messages. It is based on :term:`WebSocket` that uses :term:`JSON-RPC` v2.0 messages for making requests and sending responses.

   KMS
   Kurento Media Server
        **Kurento Media Server** is the core element of Kurento since it responsible for media transmission, processing, loading and recording.

   Maven
       `Maven <https://maven.apache.org/>`__ is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects.

   Media Element
       A **Media Element** is a module that encapsulates a specific media capability.  For example **RecorderEndpoint**, **PlayerEndpoint**, etc.

   Media Pipeline
       A :index:`Media Pipeline <single: Media; Pipeline>` is a chain of media elements, where the output stream generated by one element (source) is fed into one or more other elements input streams (sinks). Hence, the pipeline represents a "machine" capable of performing a sequence of operations over a stream.

   Media Plane
       In a traditional IP Multimedia Subsystem, the handling of media is conceptually splitted in two layers. The layer that handles the media itself -with functionalities such as media transport, encoding/decoding, and processing- is called :index:`Media Plane <single: Plane; Media>`.

          :wikipedia:`IP Multimedia Subsystem`

          :term:`Signaling Plane`

   MP4
       MPEG-4 Part 14 or MP4 is a digital multimedia format most commonly used to store video and audio, but can also be used to store other data such as subtitles and still images.

       .. seealso::

          :wikipedia:`MPEG-4 Part 14`

   Multimedia
       Multimedia is concerned with the computer controlled integration of text, graphics, video, animation, audio, and any other media where information can be represented, stored, transmitted and processed digitally.
       There is a temporal relationship between many forms of media, for instance audio, video and animations. There 2 are forms of problems involved in

           * Sequencing within the media, i.e. playing frames in correct order or time frame.
           * Synchronization, i.e. inter-media scheduling. For example, keeping video and audio synchronized or displaying captions or subtitles in the required intervals.

       .. seealso::

          :wikipedia:`Multimedia`

   Multimedia container format
       Container or wrapper formats are meta-file formats whose specification describes how different data elements and metadata coexist in a computer file.
       Simpler multimedia container formats can contain different types of audio formats, while more advanced container formats can support multiple audio and video streams, subtitles, chapter-information, and meta-data, along with the synchronization information needed to play back the various streams together.
       In most cases, the file header, most of the  metadata and the synchro chunks are specified by the container format.

       .. seealso::

          :wikipedia:`Multimedia container format <en,Digital_container_format#Multimedia_container_formats>`

   NAT
   Network Address Translation
       *Network Address Translation* (NAT) is a mechanism that hides from the public access the private IP addresses of machines inside a network. The NAT mechanism is typically found in all types of network devices, ranging from home routers to full-fledged corporate firewalls. In all cases the effect is the same: machines inside the NAT cannot be freely accessed from outside.

       NAT introduces a lot of problems for WebRTC communications: machines inside the network will be able to send data to the outside, but they won't be able to receive data from remote participants that are outside the network. In order to allow for this, NAT devices typically allow to configure **NAT bindings** to let data come in from the outside part of the network; creating these NAT bindings is what is called :term:`NAT Traversal`, also commonly referred as "opening ports".

       .. seealso::

   NAT Traversal
       NAT Traversal is a general term for techniques that establish and maintain Internet protocol connections traversing network address translation (:term:`NAT`) gateways, which break end-to-end connectivity. Intercepting and modifying traffic can only be performed transparently in the absence of secure encryption and authentication.

          :wikipedia:`QR code`

   REMB
       **Receiver Estimated Maximum Bitrate** (REMB) is a type of RTCP feedback message that a RTP receiver can use to inform the sender about what is the estimated reception bandwidth currently available for the stream itself. Upon reception of this message, the RTP sender will be able to adjust its own video bitrate to the conditions of the network. This message is a crucial part of the *Google Congestion Control* (GCC) algorithm, which provides any RTP session with the ability to adapt in cases of network congestion.

       The *GCC* algorithm is one of several proposed algorithms that have been proposed by an IETF Working Group named *RTP Media Congestion Avoidance Techniques* (RMCAT).

   REST
       Representational state transfer (REST) is an architectural style consisting of a coordinated set of constraints applied to components, connectors, and data elements, within a distributed hypermedia system. The term representational state transfer was introduced and defined in 2000 by Roy Fielding in his `doctoral dissertation <https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm>`__.

   RTP
       Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is a standard packet format designed for transmitting audio and video streams on IP networks. It is used in conjunction with the :term:`RTP Control Protocol <RTCP>`. Transmissions using the RTP audio/video profile (RTP/AVP) typically use :term:`SDP` to describe the technical parameters of the media streams.

   Same-origin policy
       The "same-origin policy" is a web application security model. The policy permits scripts running on pages originating from the same domain to access each other's :term:`DOM` with no specific restrictions, but prevents access to :term:`DOM` on different domains.

       .. seealso::

          :wikipedia:`Same-origin policy`

   SDP
   Session Description Protocol
   SDP Offer/Answer
       The **Session Description Protocol** (SDP) is a text document that describes the parameters of a streaming media session. It is commonly used to describe the characteristics of RTP streams (and related protocols such as RTSP).

       The **SDP Offer/Answer** model is a negotiation between two peers of a unicast stream, by which the sender and the receiver share the set of media streams and codecs they wish to use, along with the IP addresses and ports they would like to use to receive the media.

       This is an example SDP Offer/Answer negotiation. First, there must be a peer that wishes to initiate the negotiation; we'll call it the *offerer*. It composes the following SDP Offer and sends it to the other peer -which we'll call the *answerer*-:

       .. code-block:: text

          v=0
          o=- 0 0 IN IP4 127.0.0.1
          s=Example sender
          c=IN IP4 127.0.0.1
          t=0 0
          m=audio 5006 RTP/AVP 96
          a=rtpmap:96 opus/48000/2
          a=sendonly
          m=video 5004 RTP/AVP 103
          a=rtpmap:103 H264/90000
          a=sendonly

       Upon receiving that Offer, the *answerer* studies the parameters requested by the *offerer*, decides if they can be satisfied, and composes an appropriate SDP Answer that is sent back to the *offerer*:

       .. code-block:: text

          v=0
          o=- 3696336115 3696336115 IN IP4 192.168.56.1
          s=Example receiver
          c=IN IP4 192.168.56.1
          t=0 0
          m=audio 0 RTP/AVP 96
          a=rtpmap:96 opus/48000/2
          a=recvonly
          m=video 31278 RTP/AVP 103
          a=rtpmap:103 H264/90000
          a=recvonly

       The SDP Answer is the final step of the SDP Offer/Answer Model. With it, the *answerer* agrees to some of the parameter requested by the *offerer*, but not all.

       In this example, ``audio 0`` means that the *answerer* rejects the audio stream that the *offerer* intended to send; also, it accepts the video stream, and the ``a=recvonly`` acknowledges that the *answerer* will exclusively act as a receiver, and won't send any stream back to the other peer.

   SIP
       Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a :term:`signaling plane` protocol widely used for controlling multimedia communication sessions such as voice and video calls over Internet Protocol (IP) networks. SIP works in conjunction with several other application layer protocols:

       * :term:`SDP` for media identification and negotiation.
       * :term:`RTP`, :term:`SRTP` or :term:`WebRTC` for the transmission of media streams.

       It embeds Tomcat or Jetty directly and so there is no need to deploy WAR files in order to run web applications.

   SRTCP
       SRTCP provides the same security-related features to RTCP, as the ones provided by SRTP to RTP. Encryption, message authentication and integrity, and replay protection are the features added by SRTCP to :term:`RTCP`.

       .. seealso::

          :term:`SRTP`

   SRTP
       Secure RTP is a profile of RTP (:term:`Real-time Transport Protocol <RTP>`), intended to provide encryption, message authentication and integrity, and replay protection to the RTP data in both unicast and multicast applications. Similarly to how RTP has a sister RTCP protocol, SRTP also has a sister protocol, called Secure RTCP (or :term:`SRTCP`).

   SSL
       Secure Socket Layer. See :term:`TLS`.

   STUN
       *Session Traversal Utilities for NAT* (STUN) is a protocol that complements :term:`ICE` in the task of solving the :term:`NAT Traversal` issue. It can be used by any endpoints to determine the IP address and port allocated to it by a :term:`NAT`. It can also be used to check connectivity between two endpoints, and as a keep-alive protocol to maintain NAT bindings. STUN works with many existing types of NAT, and does not require any special behavior from them.

   Trickle ICE
       Extension to the :term:`ICE` protocol that allows ICE agents to send and receive candidates incrementally rather than exchanging complete lists. With such incremental provisioning, ICE agents can begin connectivity checks while they are still gathering candidates and considerably shorten the time necessary for ICE processing to complete.

       .. seealso::

              The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2.

   TURN
       *Traversal Using Relays around NAT* (TURN) is an extension of :term:`STUN`, used where the :term:`NAT` security policies are too strict and the needed NAT bindings cannot be successfully created to achieve :term:`NAT Traversal`. In these situations, it is necessary for the host to use the services of a TURN server that acts as a communication relay.

       .. note::

          **You don't need to set a STUN server up if you have already configured a TURN relay**, because TURN is just an extension of STUN.
