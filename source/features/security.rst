=============================
Securing Kurento Applications
=============================

[TODO full review]

Starting with Chrome 47, WebRTC is only allowed from SECURE ORIGINS (HTTPS or localhost). Check their `release notes <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/discuss-webrtc/sq5CVmY69sc>`__ for further information about this issue.

.. note::

   Keep in mind that serving your application through HTTPS, forces you to use WebSockets Secure (WSS) if you are using websockets to control your application server.



Securing Application Servers
============================

.. _features-security-java-https:

Configure a Java server to use HTTPS
------------------------------------

* The application needs a certificate in order to enable HTTPS:

   * Request a certificate from a local certification authority.

   * Create an self-signed certificate.

     .. sourcecode:: bash

        keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias selfsigned -keystore \
        keystore.jks -storepass password -validity 360 -keysize 2048

* Use the certificate in your application:

  * Include a valid keystore in the *jar* file:

    A file *keystore.jks* must be in the project's root path, and a file named *application.properties* must exist in *src/main/resources/*, with the following content:

    .. sourcecode:: text

       server.port: 8443
       server.ssl.key-store: keystore.jks
       server.ssl.key-store-password: yourPassword
       server.ssl.keyStoreType: JKS
       server.ssl.keyAlias: yourKeyAlias

    * You can also specify the location of the properties file. When launching your Spring-Boot based app, issue the flag ``-Dspring.config.location=<path-to-properties>`` .

* Start application

.. sourcecode:: bash

   mvn -U clean spring-boot:run -Dkms.url=ws://kms_host:kms_port/kurento

.. note::

   If you plan on using a webserver as proxy, like Nginx or Apache, you'll need to ``setAllowedOrigins`` when registering the handler. Please read the `official Spring documentation <https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web.html#websocket-server-allowed-origins>`__ entry for more info.



.. _features-security-node-https:

Configure a Node server to use HTTPS
------------------------------------

* You will need to provide a valid SSL certificate in order to enable HTTPS. Here, there are two alternatives:

  1. Request a certificate from a local Certification Authority (*CA*).

  2. Create your own self-signed certificate as explained `here <https://www.akadia.com/services/ssh_test_certificate.html>`__. This link will teach you how to create the required files: *server.crt*, *server.key*, and *server.csr*.

* Add the following changes to *server.js* in order to enable HTTPS:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

   ...
   var express = require('express');
   var ws = require('ws');
   var fs    = require('fs');
   var https = require('https');
   ...

   var options =
   {
     key:  fs.readFileSync('key/server.key'),
     cert: fs.readFileSync('keys/server.crt')
   };

   var app = express();

   var server = https.createServer(options, app).listen(port, function() {
   ...
   });
   ...

   var wss = new ws.Server({
    server : server,
    path : '/'
   });

   wss.on('connection', function(ws) {

   ....

* Start application

.. sourcecode:: bash

   npm start



.. _features-security-js-https:

Configure JavaScript applications to use HTTPS
----------------------------------------------

WebRTC requires HTTPS, so your JavaScript application must be served by a secure web server. You can use whichever one you prefer, such as Nginx or Apache. For quick tests, a very straightforward option is to use the simple, zero-configuration `http-server <https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server>`__ based on Node.js:

.. code-block:: bash

   curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
   sudo apt-get install --yes nodejs
   sudo npm install -g http-server

* You will need to provide a valid SSL certificate in order to enable HTTPS. Here, there are two alternatives:

  1. Request a certificate from a local Certification Authority (*CA*).

  2. Create your own self-signed certificate as explained `here <https://www.akadia.com/services/ssh_test_certificate.html>`__. This link will teach you how to create the required files: *server.crt*, *server.key*, and *server.csr*.

* Start the web server using the SSL certificate:

  .. code-block:: bash

     http-server -p 8443 --ssl --cert keys/server.crt --key keys/server.key



.. _features-security-kms-wss:

Securing Kurento Media Server
=============================

First, you need to change the configuration file of Kurento Media Server, i.e.
``/etc/kurento/kurento.conf.json``, uncommenting the following lines::

   "secure": {
     "port": 8433,
     "certificate": "defaultCertificate.pem",
     "password": ""
   },

If this PEM certificate is a signed certificate (by a Certificate Authority such
as Verisign), then you are done. If you are going to use a self-signed
certificate (suitable for development), then there is still more work to do.

You can generate a self signed certificate by doing this::

   certtool --generate-privkey --outfile defaultCertificate.pem
   echo 'organization = your organization name' > certtool.tmpl
   certtool --generate-self-signed --load-privkey defaultCertificate.pem \
      --template certtool.tmpl >> defaultCertificate.pem
   sudo chown kurento defaultCertificate.pem

Due to the fact that the certificate is self-signed, applications will reject it
by default. For this reason, you'll need to force them to accept it.

* Browser applications: You'll need to manually accept the certificate as
  trusted one before secure WebSocket connections can be established. By
  default, this can be done by connecting to https://localhost:8433/kurento
  and accepting the certificate in the browser.

* Java applications: Follow the instructions of `this link <https://www.mkyong.com/webservices/jax-ws/suncertpathbuilderexception-unable-to-find-valid-certification-path-to-requested-target/>`__
  (get ``InstallCert.java`` from
  `here <https://code.google.com/p/java-use-examples/source/browse/trunk/src/com/aw/ad/util/InstallCert.java>`__).
  You'll need to instruct the ``KurentoClient`` needs to be configured to allow
  the use of certificates. For this purpose, we need to create our own
  ``JsonRpcClient``:

.. sourcecode:: java

   SslContextFactory sec = new SslContextFactory(true);
   sec.setValidateCerts(false);
   JsonRpcClientWebSocket rpcClient = new JsonRpcClientWebSocket(uri, sec);
   KurentoClient kuretoClient = KurentoClient.createFromJsonRpcClient(rpcClient);

* Node applications: Take a look at `this page <https://github.com/coolaj86/node-ssl-root-cas/wiki/Painless-Self-Signed-Certificates-in-node.js>`__ or for a fastest but INSECURE alternative, set the TLS rejection environment variable flag (``NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED``) to 0 (false), this will disable the TLS validation for your whole node app, you can set this environment variable value before executing your app or in execution time by adding the following code before performing the connection:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

    process.env["NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED"] = 0;

After having configured the certificate in your Application Server, you have to change the WebSocket URI in your application logic, and make sure the WebSocket URL starts with ``wss://`` instead of the insecure version ``ws://``. For instance, in the *hello-world* application within the tutorials, this would be done as follows:

* Java: Changing this line in
  `HelloWorldApp.java <https://github.com/Kurento/kurento-tutorial-java/blob/master/kurento-hello-world/src/main/java/org/kurento/tutorial/helloworld/HelloWorldApp.java>`__::

   final static String DEFAULT_KMS_WS_URI = "wss://localhost:8433/kurento";

* Browser JavaScript: Changing this line in
  `index.js <https://github.com/Kurento/kurento-tutorial-js/blob/master/kurento-hello-world/js/index.js>`__::

   const ws_uri = 'wss://' + location.hostname + ':8433/kurento';

* Node.js: Changing this line in
  `server.js <https://github.com/Kurento/kurento-tutorial-node/blob/master/kurento-hello-world/server.js>`__::

   const ws_uri = "wss://localhost:8433/kurento";

* All: Passing the WebSocket URL to the Application as a startup parameter (see each individual tutorial page to get the syntax for doing so).
